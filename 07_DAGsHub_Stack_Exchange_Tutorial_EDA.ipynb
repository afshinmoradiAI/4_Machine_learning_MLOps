    "\n",
    "We got a good sense of our data, the type of preprocessing required, and managed to train some decent classifiers with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point in a Python data science project, it's common to take the conclusions and working code from the exploratory notebook, and turn them into normal Python modules. This enables us to more easily:\n",
    "* Create reusable components that will be useful as the project matures.\n",
    "* Use code versioning tools like Git.\n",
    "* Make the process more reproducible by defining a clear pipeline (order of operations) for the data and model training.\n",
    "* Automate running and tracking of experiments.\n",
    "* Version our different experiments and models, so that we preserve knowledge and don't risk losing work by accident.\n",
    "\n",
    "[In the next level of DAGsHub's tutorial](https://dagshub.com/docs/experiment-tutorial/1-setup/), we'll take what works from this notebook and turn it into a Python project, before [going forward with experimentation](https://dagshub.com/docs/experiment-tutorial/2-experiments/) to find the best performing model for out problem.\n",
